# Manufacturing_Analytics_Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing operations using Power BI. The goal is to monitor: Production trends, Machine performance, Equipment effectiveness (OEE), Shift productivity, Defect rates, Energy efficiency and Predictive maintenance indicators

🎯 Problem Statement

Manufacturing companies need real-time visibility into production performance, downtime, quality levels, and energy usage to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs.

This project aims to:

Identify production fluctuations over time

Compare machine-level performance

Detect high defect rate machines

Evaluate energy efficiency

Predict potential maintenance risks

📂 Dataset Source

Dataset Name: Manufacturing Sales–Production–Logistics Dataset

The dataset contains information such as:

Date

Machine ID

Units Produced

Downtime (minutes)
